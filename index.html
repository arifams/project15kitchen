					<p><img class="img-circle1" src="assets/img/arif.jpg"> My name is Arif and I do believe life is beautiful. Some of my friends and family called me with many different names but it doesn't matter. The most important thing is; I do have friends and family, they are really awesome human being. On May 2016 I finished my study as a chef. During my study  there were a lot of awesome people keep encouraging me to move forward and walk this path. Nobody said it was an easy walk but nobody also said it was an impossible task. So here I am, create my own happines with a journey to 15 friends and family kitchen. To cook. To learn. To share. To build. To thankful. I don't know what it will bring me but I won't worry. As I believe that the intention is pure so is our soul, our heart, our cups and our walk will lead us to a beautiful journey. </p>

				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>I do developing apps sometime but once upon a time a was so ill and I cannot build any apps at that time. After long and winding road to find the cure I found out that actually eat proper food does really help to get back to my own health. What we consume really does take a huge part of our life (or at least my life). So while developing mobile apps for recipe collected during this journey, I'm gonna learn from my host as I know they also have their own wisdom and knowledge about what do they eat and treat their food at their kitchen. I hope we can share or perhaps create together a better life through the food that we consume. If you would like to know, <a href="#contact" class="smoothScroll">contact me here</a> for the update. Bear with me, my friends :)

					<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/pirate_cook.png" alt="" style="float:left; padding: 10px;">
					I love comic strip book called One Piece. A story about a bunch of crazy funny pirates climbing their roles on the seven seas. One of the main character is Sanji. Sanji's most easily noticeable characteristics is the kind, calm, cool, and collected manner in which he carries himself. He is more perceptive than he seems, and often tells people what they need to hear instead of what they want. He does admit that he is not perfect. <br>
				Well, I'm not Sanji (who has the symbol's of skull with cutlery and got nicknamed as 'ero-cook') the chef on the pirate ship. I'm Arif. But I do admit I'm not perfect and even far from that. I am a sinner, I'm a cook, I'm an adventurer, I'm a coder, I'm a yogist, I'm a father, I'm a man, I play, I cursed, I fuck, I laughed, I cried. Meh, I have my ups and down. This path was not always smooth but heck yeah always do keep moving forward. Love from family, friends and the people that I'd met always give me a freedom feeling. This is my journey to the one that I love. The journey that literally spice up with herbs. <a href="#contact" class="smoothScroll">Join with me, mon amie</a>. We raise the sail. Catch the wind. Look beyond the horizon. Together. For freedom!

									5l red wine
									2l Catalonia Champagne (Cava)
									1,5l orange soda
									1,5l lemon soda
									You can add extra 1l pineapple juice and 1l apple juice for more fruity flavour.
									First add pieces of lemon, orange and apple to the wine and let it macerate for 5 hours at least. Then add the rest and serve it so cool with ice! 😊</p>
